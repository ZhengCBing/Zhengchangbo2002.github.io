## Integrated Circuit Design (individual project) 
Researcher, Instructor: Jiangmin Gu July 2023 – September 2023
The project aimed to design and draw LDO circuits using virtual machines

- Calculated, tuned and collected data to explore Bandgap Reference (BGR) theory through practical circuit 
  construction with discrete components
- Used CMOS-based operational amplifiers, diodes and resistors, designed a BGR recursive Low-Dropout (LDO) regulators
  to isolate ripple suppression from the BGR circuit to reduce complexity and achieve lower power consumption
- Participated in the design of LDO circuitry with CADENCE software to evaluate the interplay among modules like BGR
  sources, error amplifier, power tube and resistor feedback networks
- Assessed the interaction of each module in the design and analysis of LDO circuits; it includes how the design of 
  the BGR source affected output noise and voltage regulation; the influence from the gain and bandwidth error 
  amplifier on load adjustment rate, linear adjustment rate and transient response ability of LDO; the size and on- 
  resistance of the power tube may have effects on the pressure difference and static current of LDO; the output 
  voltage and static power consumption of the LDO is affected by the resistance value of the resistance feedback 
  network
- Engaged in the design and poster design of voltage BGR and LDO regulators, and then joined the college SURF 
  competition
  (Made posters to be exhibited by the school)


## The Development and Practice of Virtual Machine (team project) 
Research Assistant, Instructor: Jieming Ma July 2022 – September 2022
The project aimed to design a photovoltaic intelligent debris collector on water on an autonomous solar-powered watercraft for targeted river cleaning. The design featured PV panels and waste collection cages within its energy compartment. The synergy turntables system was adopted to increase the collection efficiency. And The team cooperated to make a photovoltaic robot to clean up the river, and applied for a patent.
- Built a 3D model in Rhino and imported the robot operating system, established a static model in Gazebo, and 
  simulated the working space for the robot including river flow with coding
- Programmed the virtual machine with PyVmomi in Python, VMware ESXi and vCenter servers; designed controller and 
  communication protocols and generated control program; materialized the PV robot for cleaning, maintenance and 
  monitoring by welding components and chips
- Stored and processed the real-time data of both robots and targeted garbage in the central unit and application, 
  then analyzed and visualized the information after proper cleaning and conversion
- Upgraded the design with harmonious hardware and software to tackle the format inconsistency between output signals 
  from the sensor and input ones of the software
- Designed the project poster and participated in the college SURF competition (Made posters to be exhibited by the 
  school)
